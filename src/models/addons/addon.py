# Addons are similar to hooks, however, they differ by:
# 1. Addons are nn.Module rather than functions, which allows them to be trainable.
# 2. Hooks are meant to be used in debuging or profiling, while addons are long-term modifications to the model.
# 3. Addons are more flexible than hooks, they may have variables that control their behavior, and
# the user can decide when to change the variables.
